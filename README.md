# EventManage

This was created for a group assignment during my time at university. The assignment was the creation of an event management system that would be able to be used by university employees to create and manage events, as well as for students to purchase tickets.

The idea was that the program would use the universities user database to verify and allow logins for the program, securely.

Unfortunately, this was a project I had to fully complete on my own in a group of 3 as the other two members were not confident in their programming abilities. This led to an unfortunate lack of security with how accounts are stored for the program - something I would have remedied if I had more time for this project.
